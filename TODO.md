- Add a command that finds the number of bytes in files only
- Use serde to serialize the actual Path object so you don't have to worry about paths with spaces, etc.
- Note how many bytes per file in hashes file so that that can be compared before bothering to hash
- Currently specific to unix where filenames can be seen as a vector of u8's.  Generalize
- Use serde to perform serialization of path to base64 (just trying to remove spaces).
